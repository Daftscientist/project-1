## Installation

Download the files:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Daftscientist/my-pterodactyl
```
Unzip the downloaded files:
```shell
Ubuntu: unzip my-pterodactyl-main.zip -d my-pterodactyl-main
Windows: zip file. tar -xf my-pterodactyl-main.zip
```
Check if python is installed:
```shell
python â€“version
OR
python3 -version
```
Make sure PIP package manager is installed:
```shell
python -m pip --version
OR
python3 -m pip --version
```
Install required dependencies:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
OR
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the backend API:
```shell
cd Backend
sanic main
```
Use `ctrl+c` to stop the backend running.

### Development tips

Creating virtual environments:
```shell
python -m venv
OR
python3 -m venv
```
Entering the virtual environment:
```shell
Unix or MacOS - bash shell: source /venv/bin/activate
Unix or MacOS - csh shell: source /venv/bin/activate.csh
Unix or MacOS - fish shell: source /venv/bin/activate.fish
Windows - Command Prompt: venv\Scripts\activate.bat
Windows - PowerShell: venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
Running the backend API with live reloading (e.g. watchdog):
```shell
cd Backend
sanic main --dev
```
Running the backend API in debug mode:
```shell
cd Backend
sanic main --debug
```
You can combine `sanic main --dev --debug` for development.

## Usage

Creating a user:
```python
import requests

API_URL = "http://localhost:8080/"

response = requests.post(API_URL + "/api/v1/user/create", json={
  "username": "example_username",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password1",
  "repeated_password": "password1"
})
print(response.json())
```
Logging out (cookies from login must be included in request):
```python
import requests

API_URL = "http://localhost:8080/"

response = requests.post(API_URL + "/api/v1/user/logout", cookies={'session': 'jwt-encoded-string'})
print(response.json())
```

## Responses
Example error:
```json
{
  "error": "Page not found",
  "status": 404,
  "path": "/api/v1/user/nothing",
   "request_id": "reuqest-id",
  "timestamp": "May 10, 2023, 12:00:00 AM"
 }
```
